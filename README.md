Intelligent & Reconfigurable Wireless Physical Layer (PHY)
Project Overview
This repository contains the Verilog code for a reconfigurable Physical Layer (PHY) designed for high efficiency and adaptability in wireless communication systems. The design leverages the flexibility of FPGA architectures to enable dynamic modulation, coding, and other PHY functionalities based on real-time environmental feedback.

Features
Dynamic Reconfiguration: Utilizes FPGA capabilities for on-the-fly changes in processing logic based on the channel conditions.
Modulation Schemes: Supports QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes dynamically switchable according to the algorithmic control.
Signal Processing Blocks: Includes IFFT/FFT operations, pilot insertion, synchronization, and more, implemented through a mix of Xilinx IP cores and custom Verilog modules.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
I would like to thank T. H. Pham(https://github.com/phthinh) for source codes used in the implementation of wireless PHY.
